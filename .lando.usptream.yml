# This file sets some good defaults for the local development of a platform.sh
# Symfony project using Lando.
#
# Note that you should not edit this file so it can continue to receive upstream
# updates. If you wish to change the values below then override them in your
# normal .lando.yml.

# These both allow you to test this template without needing a site on platform.sh
# However you will want to replace them in your .lando.yml
